## Eorzea Companion Clock (Name tbd)

Eorzea Companion Clock is a helper application meant to help players for Final Fantasy 14 to keep track of the in-game Eorzean time while alt-tabbed or not in game.
This is to make it easy to keep track of rare spawn timers for Mining and Botany nodes.  This project is currently early in development.
